Version 1.2.20 (August 20th 2020)

* Mod is now compatible with the RimWorld 1.2 patch.

Version 1.2.19 (June 1st 2020)

* Reduced melee damage and power of golf clubs by approximately one third.
* Increased stuff cost of making golf clubs to 125 (was 75).
* Tribal factions are now able to build putting holes.

Version 1.2.16 (May 22nd 2020)

* Reduced accuracy of golf club (ranged) by 0.2 across all ranges (touch, short, medium, long).
* Increased base damage of golf club (ranged) to 30 (was 25).
* Reduced projectile speed of golf club (ranged) to 75 (was 90).
* Reduced base damage of golf balls (projectile) to 15 (was 30).
* Reduced stopping power of golf balls (projectile) to 1 (was 2).
	* Author's Note: I noticed that even a good quality ranged club was killing some targets in one hit; reducing damage and stopping power of golf balls should make that less likely to happen.
* Changed recipe of golf club (ranged) to use the same format as the melee version (75 wood or metal instead of steel and components).
* Increased work cost of both golf clubs to 900 (was 600).
* Fixed error on startup about an invalid sound; the ranged golf club now uses the same sound as throwing a grenade.
	* Author's Note: Throwing a grenade makes a sort of 'swoosh' noise; it's the closest thing I could find to the sound of a golf club being swung.
* Recipes to make golf clubs should now appear at both variants of the smithy.
* Putting hole can no longer be made using stone blocks or metals.
* Both variants of the golf club can now be made at a crafting spot.
* Reduced crafting skill requirement of golf club (ranged) to 3 (was 5).
* Changed golf club texture to something a little better.

Version 1.2.2 (May 15th 2020)

* Added golf club (ranged), a slow firing weapon with poor accuracy that is capable of doing a fair chunk of damage on a successful hit.
* Added putting hole, a recreation item that trains your colonists shooting skill at a slightly better rate than the horseshoes pin and hoopstone ring.
* Reduced work amount of making golf club (melee) to 600 (was 6000).
